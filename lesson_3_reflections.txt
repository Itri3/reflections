When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing with others, or across multiple devices

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Same as not all changes need/should be commited immediately. Also could cause unnecessary traffic load.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branch is within repository - try new feature in isolated commits
clone is between repositories - download remote repository
fork is between repositories on GitHub only - create own repository based on someone else work, while still crediting him
