When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing with others, or across multiple devices

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Same as not all changes need/should be commited immediately. Also could cause unnecessary traffic load.
